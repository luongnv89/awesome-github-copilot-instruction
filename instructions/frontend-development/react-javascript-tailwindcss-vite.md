# React JavaScript Development with Vite and TailwindCSS

## Project Context
Guidelines for developing React applications using JavaScript, Vite, and TailwindCSS with modern best practices.

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Pass props with PropTypes for validation
- Avoid using React.FC (not needed in JavaScript)
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use TailwindCSS for styling

## Architecture Patterns
- Implement container/presenter pattern
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Follow atomic design principles
- Implement proper state management
- Use proper folder structure

## Testing Requirements
- Use React Testing Library
- Write tests for hooks
- Test component rendering
- Test user interactions
- Implement integration tests

## Documentation Standards
- Document component props using comments and PropTypes
- Include usage examples
- Document custom hooks
- Add storybook stories

## Project-Specific Rules
- Use Vite for project setup and bundling
- Use TailwindCSS for styling consistency
- Implement proper SEO practices
- Use proper image optimization
- Implement accessibility standards
- Follow performance best practices
- Ensure AI-generated code always includes complete, runnable files with necessary imports and configurations
- Provide full component structures, including `index.js` and `App.js` when needed
- Include TailwindCSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) and Vite setup files (`vite.config.js`) when relevant
